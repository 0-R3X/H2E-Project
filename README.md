# H2E-Project
 Team Name - IWY
 Theme - Homeschooling made easy through NIOS
 Solution - 
 
As we know that NIOS students don't get enough time to study due to their poor financial conditions. So they work in the day time and study in their leisure time. So,
we are providing a platform for the students to study according to there level. we'll assess the students and classify them accordingly then we will provide content in form of youtube playlists. The students will be provided with the course content and exercises based on their levels. we will also classify the content that is to be provided to the students according to the time they can devote to their studies in 2 categories i.e. the deep knowledge of the content and second will be real life problems and majority weightage content. deep learning will cover the content of the second category as well as the content that revolves around the topic.
